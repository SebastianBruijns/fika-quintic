I can keep on shuffling around the solutions

But there's no quintic formula which could keep on keeping up with this shuffling

roots uniquely induce coefficients, but coefficients don't uniquely induce solution (they can always be permuted)

for quadratic, there's no cont. func. giving us a solution, cause it's continuously swappable, that's why we need the square root

does the square root buy this: the set of solutions hasn't changed! yes, z1 is now different, but the overall set is still the same
he doesn't argue like that at all...
no, it's more about changing z_1, without there being any reason for it changing, but I'm not quite there yet...

but I thought we had this multi valueness precisely because things can switch around...
yes, but if we undo the phase changes, then things should be back to where they started. but they aren't always. now it starts to make sense
!because roots can change when there is a phase shift!
